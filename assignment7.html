    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <span style="background-color: yellow;">periodic table</span></a> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction</i>:</p>
    <p><p style="font-size: small;">2H + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p></p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(H<sub>2</sub>)</i> and oxygen gas <i>(O<sub>2</sub>)</i> to form water <i>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</i>.</p>

    <h3>Important Concepts</h3>
    <p><span class="Stoichiometry"><B>Stoichiometry</B></span> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
